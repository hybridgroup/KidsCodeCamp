    %h1 What Is KidsCodeCamp?
    %p Here is how KidsCodeCamp works:
    %p Local volunteers will run hands-on classes intended for a particular age group (elementary, middle, or high-school age kids). Each class is from 1 to 2 hours long.
    %p Kids register for free, just so everyone knows how many people will be coming.
    %p Everyone has fun on the day of KidsCodeCamp!
